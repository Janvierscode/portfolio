# Visual Assets for Your Portfolio

This directory is intended to store visual assets (images, charts, dashboard screenshots) for your data analyst portfolio.

## General Assets:

*   **Profile Picture:** Store your professional headshot here (e.g., `profile_picture.jpg`).

## Project-Specific Assets:

As you complete each project, save relevant visualizations here. Consider creating subdirectories for each project if it helps with organization (e.g., `assets/images/project1_stock_analysis/`).
