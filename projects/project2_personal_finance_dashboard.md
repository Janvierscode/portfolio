## Project 2: Personal Finance Management Dashboard

**Objective:**
To develop a comprehensive system and interactive dashboard for tracking, categorizing, and analyzing personal financial transactions. The goal is to gain insights into spending habits, monitor budget adherence, identify areas for savings, and improve overall financial planning. This project will showcase skills in data cleaning, data modeling, and dashboard creation using tools like Excel, Python, and Power BI or Tableau.

**Problem Statement:**
Many individuals struggle to get a clear understanding of where their money goes, making it difficult to manage budgets effectively and achieve financial goals. This project aims to create a user-friendly solution to organize transactional data, visualize spending patterns, and provide actionable insights for better personal finance management.

**Data Sources:**
*   Anonymized personal bank account and credit card transaction data. This could be:
    *   A sample dataset of transactions (many are available online, or you can create one).
    *   Your own financial data, carefully anonymized ( by removing names, account numbers, and specific merchant details if sharing the project publicly).
*   Data should include fields like: Date, Description/Merchant, Category (or raw data to be categorized), Amount.
*   A self-defined budget for various spending categories.

**Tools & Technologies (Planned):**
*   **Excel:**
    *   For initial data input/collection (if using manually entered data or simple CSV exports).
    *   Data cleaning and pre-processing.
    *   Creating budgets and mapping transactions to categories.
    *   Basic pivot tables and charts for preliminary analysis.
*   **Python (Optional but Recommended for deeper analysis):**
    *   `pandas`: For robust data cleaning, transformation, and categorization logic (sing rules or keywords to assign categories to transactions).
    *   `NumPy`: For numerical calculations.
    *   `Matplotlib`/`Seaborn`: For generating custom static visualizations.
*   **Power BI / Tableau:**
    *   For creating a comprehensive and interactive dashboard to visualize spending trends, budget vs. actual, savings, and other key financial metrics.

**Methodology & Key Analysis Steps:**

1.  **Data Collection & Standardization:**
    *   Gather transaction data from various sources (if applicable) into a standardized format (CSV or Excel).
    *   Define a clear set of spending categories and sub-categories.

2.  **Data Cleaning & Categorization:**
    *   Handle missing data or inconsistencies in transaction descriptions.
    *   Clean merchant names for consistency.
    *   Develop a robust method (manual in Excel, or automated/rule-based in Python) to assign each transaction to a predefined spending category.

3.  **Budgeting:**
    *   Define monthly or annual budgets for each spending category.

4.  **Data Analysis & Metric Calculation:**
    *   Calculate total spending per category and sub-category over different periods (monthly, quarterly, annually).
    *   Analyze spending trends over time.
    *   Compare actual spending against budgeted amounts and calculate variances.
    *   Identify top spending categories and merchants.
    *   Calculate savings rate and other relevant personal finance ratios.

5.  **Visualization & Dashboarding (Power BI/Tableau):**
    *   Design an intuitive dashboard with key sections:
        *   **Overview:** Summary of total income (if included), total expenses, net savings, budget adherence.
        *   **Spending Breakdown:** Pie charts or tree maps showing spending distribution by category.
        *   **Trend Analysis:** Line charts showing spending in key categories over time.
        *   **Budget vs. Actual:** Bar charts or tables comparing budgeted amounts to actual spending for each category, highlighting variances.
        *   **Transaction Explorer (Optional):** A detailed view or table allowing users to filter and search for specific transactions.
    *   Use interactive elements like slicers for date ranges, categories, and accounts.

**Expected Findings & Deliverables:**
*   A clean, categorized dataset of personal financial transactions.
*   Clear visualizations of spending patterns, such as most significant expense categories and trends over time.
*   A comparison of actual spending against a defined budget, highlighting areas of overspending or savings.
*   An interactive dashboard (Power BI/Tableau) that provides a holistic view of personal finances and allows for easy exploration of the data.
*   (If Python is used) A Jupyter Notebook detailing the data cleaning, categorization, and analysis process.
*   A summary of insights and actionable recommendations for improving personal financial health (areas to cut back, savings opportunities).

**Potential Business Impact/Use Case:**
While this is a "personal" finance project, the skills are highly transferable to business contexts. It demonstrates proficiency in data ETL (Extract, Transform, Load), data modeling, dashboard development, and deriving actionable insights from transactional data â€“ skills valuable in financial planning & analysis (FP&A), business intelligence, and any role requiring budget management or cost analysis.
