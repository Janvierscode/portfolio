## Project 4: Financial News Sentiment Analysis for Market Trends

**Objective:**
To collect financial news articles or headlines related to specific companies or market sectors, perform sentiment analysis to quantify the prevailing sentiment (positive, negative, neutral), and analyze potential correlations between news sentiment and stock price movements or market volatility. This project aims to showcase skills in web scraping or API usage, text preprocessing, sentiment analysis (NLP), and data integration.

**Problem Statement:**
Market sentiment, heavily influenced by news and media, can significantly impact financial markets and individual stock prices. Understanding the collective sentiment expressed in financial news can provide valuable context for investment strategies and risk assessment. This project explores how sentiment analysis can be used to derive insights from textual financial data.

**Data Sources:**
*   **News Data:**
    *   Financial news headlines/articles collected via:
        *   News APIs (e.g., NewsAPI.org, Alpha Vantage news & sentiment, EOD Historical Data news API - many have free tiers for limited use).
        *   Web scraping financial news websites (e.g., Reuters, Bloomberg, Yahoo Finance news sections) for specific company news or market news. (Note: Be mindful of website terms of service if scraping).
*   **Market Data:**
    *   Historical daily stock price data (Adjusted Close) for the companies or market index corresponding to the news collected. This can be sourced using `yfinance` or other financial data APIs.

**Tools & Technologies (Planned):**
*   **Python:**
    *   `requests`, `BeautifulSoup4` (if scraping): For fetching web content.
    *   News API client libraries (if using APIs).
    *   `pandas`: For organizing news data, sentiment scores, and market data.
    *   `NLTK` (Natural Language Toolkit) or `spaCy`: For text preprocessing (tokenization, stop word removal, lemmatization).
    *   Sentiment Analysis Libraries:
        *   `VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner)`: Good for social media and general text, often effective for news headlines.
        *   `TextBlob`: Another popular library for sentiment analysis.
        *   Transformer-based models (e.g., from Hugging Face `transformers` library like FinBERT): For more sophisticated, finance-specific sentiment (more advanced).
    *   `Matplotlib` & `Seaborn`: For visualizing sentiment scores, trends, and correlations with market data.
    *   `yfinance` or similar: For fetching stock market data.
*   **Excel (Optional):**
    *   To manage lists of keywords, companies, or news sources.
    *   For basic charting of sentiment scores if not doing it all in Python.
*   **Tableau / Power BI (Optional):**
    *   To create dashboards visualizing sentiment trends over time, comparing sentiment for different entities, and overlaying sentiment with stock price charts.

**Methodology & Key Analysis Steps:**

1.  **Data Collection:**
    *   Define target companies, sectors, or keywords for news collection.
    *   Collect news articles/headlines and associated metadata (e.g., publication date, source) using an API or web scraping.
    *   Collect corresponding historical stock price data for the same period.

2.  **Text Preprocessing:**
    *   Clean the text data: Remove HTML tags (if scraped), special characters, and irrelevant information.
    *   Perform standard NLP preprocessing: Tokenization, conversion to lowercase, stop-word removal, lemmatization/stemming.

3.  **Sentiment Analysis:**
    *   Apply a chosen sentiment analysis tool/model (e.g., VADER, TextBlob, or a Transformer model) to each news item to get a sentiment score (e.g., a polarity score ranging from -1 to +1, and/or a classification like positive/negative/neutral).
    *   Aggregate sentiment scores daily or weekly for each company/sector.

4.  **Data Integration & Analysis:**
    *   Merge the aggregated sentiment data with the historical stock market data based on dates.
    *   Analyze the relationship between sentiment scores and stock returns/volatility:
        *   Plot sentiment scores and stock prices on the same timeline.
        *   Calculate correlation coefficients between sentiment and price changes (e.g., does positive sentiment precede price increases?).
        *   Look for event-driven changes: how does sentiment shift around major company announcements or market events?

5.  **Visualization & Reporting:**
    *   Create time series plots of sentiment scores.
    *   Develop visualizations to show the correlation between sentiment and market movements.
    *   (If using Tableau/Power BI) Build a dashboard to interactively explore news sentiment and its potential market impact.

**Expected Findings & Deliverables:**
*   A dataset of financial news items with corresponding sentiment scores.
*   Analysis and visualizations showing trends in news sentiment for selected entities.
*   An assessment of the correlation (or lack thereof) between news sentiment and stock market performance.
*   A Jupyter Notebook detailing the entire process: data collection, preprocessing, sentiment analysis, data integration, and correlational analysis.
*   A summary report or presentation discussing the methodology, findings, limitations, and potential applications of financial news sentiment analysis.
*   (Optional) An interactive dashboard for exploring the data.

**Potential Business Impact/Use Case:**
This project demonstrates skills in NLP and the ability to extract insights from unstructured text data, which is increasingly important in finance. Such analysis can be a component of algorithmic trading strategies (though this project is a simplified version), risk management (gauging market panic or euphoria), and understanding brand perception or event impact for companies.
