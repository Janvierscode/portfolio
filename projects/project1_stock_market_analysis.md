## Project 1: Stock Market Performance Analysis & Visualization

**Objective:**
To analyze historical stock price data for a selected portfolio of companies and a major market index S&P 500 to identify performance trends, volatility, correlations, and to develop an interactive dashboard for visualizing these insights. This project aims to showcase skills in financial data acquisition, time series analysis, and data visualization using Python, and potentially Excel, Tableau or Power BI.

**Problem Statement:**
Investors and financial analysts continuously seek to understand stock market dynamics, compare the performance of individual stocks against broader market trends, and assess risk. This project addresses the need for a clear, data-driven approach to analyzing and visualizing stock performance to aid in investment decision-making.

**Data Sources:**
*   Historical daily stock price data (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume, Adjusted Close) for 3-5 publicly traded companies from different sectors.
*   Historical daily price data for a relevant market index (S&P 500 <!--, NASDAQ Composite-->).
*   Data to be sourced using a financial data API Yahoo Finance via `yfinance` library in Python, Alpha Vantage, IEX Cloud for a period of the last 3-5 years.

**Tools & Technologies (Planned):**
*   **Python:**
    *   `yfinance` or similar: For fetching stock market data.
    *   `pandas`: For data manipulation, cleaning, and time series analysis (calculating returns and moving averages).
    *   `NumPy`: For numerical operations.
    *   `Matplotlib` & `Seaborn`: For static visualizations and initial exploratory data analysis.
    *   `SciPy`: For statistical analysis (calculating Sharpe ratio, beta).
*   **Excel (Optional):**
    *   For ad-hoc analysis, manual data comparison, or creating specific financial charts if preferred.
*   **Tableau / Power BI:**
    *   For developing an interactive dashboard to visualize performance trends, comparisons, and key metrics.

**Methodology & Key Analysis Steps:**

1.  **Data Acquisition & Preparation:**
    *   Fetch historical stock and index data using Python.
    *   Clean the data: Handle missing values, check for data integrity.
    *   Calculate daily returns for each stock and the index.
    *   Calculate key metrics: moving averages (50-day, 200-day), annualized volatility.

2.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
    *   Visualize individual stock price trends and returns over time.
    *   Plot distributions of daily returns.
    *   Analyze trading volumes.

3.  **Performance Analysis:**
    *   Calculate cumulative returns for each stock and the index.
    *   Compare individual stock performance against the market index.
    *   Calculate risk metrics such as standard deviation of returns (volatility), Beta (correlation with the market), and Sharpe Ratio (risk-adjusted return).
    *   Analyze correlations between the selected stocks.

4.  **Visualization & Dashboarding:**
    *   **Using Python (Matplotlib/Seaborn):** Generate initial plots of price trends, returns, moving averages, correlation heatmaps.
    *   **Using Tableau/Power BI:**
        *   Create a main dashboard summarizing the performance of the selected stocks and the index.
        *   Include interactive charts:
            *   Line charts for historical prices and cumulative returns (allow stock selection).
            *   Bar charts for key metrics ( annualized return, volatility and Sharpe ratio).
            *   Scatter plots to show correlation between stocks or stock vs. index returns.
            *   Histograms of daily returns.
        *   Allow users to select date ranges for analysis.

**Expected Findings & Deliverables:**
*   A clear comparison of how each selected stock performed over the chosen period relative to each other and the market index.
*   Identification of periods of high/low volatility for each stock.
*   Quantified risk and return metrics for each stock.
*   An interactive dashboard (Tableau/Power BI) allowing users to explore stock performance visually.
*   A well-documented Jupyter Notebook (if Python is heavily used for analysis) detailing the data acquisition, cleaning, analysis steps, and code.
*   A summary report or presentation of key findings and insights.

**Potential Business Impact/Use Case:**
This project demonstrates the ability to perform fundamental stock performance analysis, a core skill for equity analysts, portfolio managers, and individual investors. The dashboard provides an accessible way to monitor and compare investments.
