## Project 3: Credit Risk Analysis / Loan Default Prediction (Simplified)

**Objective:**
To analyze a dataset of loan applications to identify key factors influencing loan defaults and to build a simplified classification model to predict the likelihood of a borrower defaulting. This project aims to showcase skills in exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and basic machine learning for a common financial risk assessment task.

**Problem Statement:**
Lending institutions face the risk of borrowers defaulting on loans, leading to financial losses. By analyzing historical loan data, institutions can identify characteristics associated with higher default risk and build predictive models to inform lending decisions, set appropriate interest rates, or determine required collateral. This project provides a simplified approach to this problem.

**Data Sources:**
*   A publicly available loan dataset. Examples include:
    *   Lending Club Loan Data (available on Kaggle, though it's very large and might need significant sub-sampling and simplification).
    *   German Credit Data (from UCI Machine Learning Repository).
    *   Other credit approval or loan default datasets found on platforms like Kaggle or in academic repositories.
*   The dataset should ideally contain borrower characteristics (income, employment length, credit score, loan amount, loan purpose, home ownership) and a target variable indicating whether the loan defaulted or was fully paid.

**Tools & Technologies (Planned):**
*   **Python:**
    *   `pandas`: For data loading, cleaning, manipulation, and EDA.
    *   `NumPy`: For numerical computations.
    *   `Matplotlib` & `Seaborn`: For data visualization during EDA (distributions of variables<!--, relationships between features and defaults-->).
    *   `scikit-learn`: For:
        *   Data preprocessing ( `StandardScaler` for numerical features, `OneHotEncoder` for categorical features).
        *   Splitting data into training and testing sets (`train_test_split`).
        *   Building classification models (Logistic Regression, <!--Decision Tree, Random Forest -->).
        *   Evaluating model performance (accuracy<!--, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC AUC-->).
*   **Excel (Optional):**
    *   For initial data inspection or creating summary tables of EDA findings.
*   **Tableau / Power BI (Optional):**
    *   To create visualizations of borrower demographics, default rates across different segments, or to display model performance metrics.

**Methodology & Key Analysis Steps:**

1.  **Data Acquisition & Understanding:**
    *   Load the chosen dataset.
    *   Understand the meaning of each feature and the target variable (loan default status).

2.  **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:**
    *   Handle missing values (imputation <!--or removal-->).
    *   Correct data types.
    *   Identify and handle outliers if necessary.
    *   Encode categorical variables (one-hot encoding <!--or label encoding-->).
    *   Scale numerical features if required by the chosen model.

3.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
    *   Analyze the distribution of the target variable (default vs. non-default) to check for class imbalance.
    *   Explore relationships between individual features and the likelihood of default using visualizations (bar charts for default rates by loan purpose<!--, box plots for income of defaulters vs. non-defaulters-->).
    *   Examine correlations between features.

4.  **Feature Engineering (Optional but often beneficial):**
    *   Create new features from existing ones if it makes sense (debt-to-income ratio).

5.  **Model Building & Training (Simplified):**
    *   Split the data into training and testing sets.
    *   Select a few simple classification models (Logistic Regression<!--, Decision Tree-->).
    *   Train the models on the training data.

6.  **Model Evaluation:**
    *   Evaluate the performance of the models on the test set using appropriate metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrix, ROC AUC).
    *   Interpret the results: What does the model tell us about the predictors of default?

7.  **Visualization & Reporting:**
    *   Summarize EDA findings with key charts.
    *   Present model performance metrics clearly.
    *   (If using Tableau/Power BI) Create visuals to explain factors influencing default risk.

**Expected Findings & Deliverables:**
*   A clean, preprocessed dataset ready for modeling.
*   Key insights from EDA identifying factors correlated with loan defaults.
*   One or more trained classification models.
*   A performance evaluation of the models, including discussion of their strengths and weaknesses.
*   A Jupyter Notebook detailing all steps: data loading, cleaning, EDA, feature engineering (if any), model building, and evaluation.
*   A summary report or presentation explaining the analysis, findings, and model outcomes.
*   (Optional) A Tableau/Power BI dashboard visualizing default risk factors.

**Potential Business Impact/Use Case:**
This project demonstrates an understanding of credit risk fundamentals and the application of data science techniques to a critical financial problem. Skills showcased are valuable for roles in credit risk management, financial analysis, and data science within financial institutions. Even a simplified model can show the process of identifying and quantifying risk.
