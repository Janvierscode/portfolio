*   **`skills.md`**: A list of your technical and soft skills. **(Needs personalization)**
*   **`_config.yml`**: Jekyll configuration file. Contains site title, description, and theme selection. **(Needs personalization - especially 'title' and optional GitHub/LinkedIn URLs)**
*   **`projects/`**: This directory contains individual Markdown files for each portfolio project.
    *   `project1_stock_market_analysis.md` **(Template - requires actual project work & content)**

    *   `assets/images/README.md`: Provides guidance on the types of images to include.

## Next Steps for You:

1.  **Clone this Repository (if you haven't already):**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd <repository_name>
    ```

2.  **Personalize Core Files:**
    *   Edit `_config.yml`: Update `title` with your name. Optionally add your `github_username` and `linkedin_url`.
    *   Edit `about_me.md`: Write your personal introduction.
    *   Edit `skills.md`: Accurately list your skills.

3.  **Complete Your Data Analysis Projects:**
    *   For each project template in the `projects/` directory:
        *   Perform the actual data analysis using the tools you plan to showcase (Python, Excel, Power BI, Tableau).
        *   Document your process, findings, and insights in the respective Markdown file.
        *   Create compelling visualizations (charts, graphs, dashboard screenshots).
        *   Save these visuals in the `assets/images/` directory (consider creating subfolders like `assets/images/project1/`).
        *   Embed these visuals into your project Markdown files using Markdown syntax: `![Alt text for image](assets/images/your_image.png)` (adjust paths as needed).

4.  **Refine `index.md`:**
    *   Update your name.
    *   Consider adding brief descriptions for each project under their links.

5.  **Set up GitHub Pages:**
    *   Create a new public repository on GitHub (or use this one if it's already set up).
    *   Push your local changes to the GitHub repository:
        ```bash
        git add .
        git commit -m "Personalize portfolio content and add initial project work"
        git push origin main # Or your default branch name
        ```
    *   Go to your repository settings on GitHub.
    *   Navigate to the "Pages" section in the left sidebar.
    *   Under "Build and deployment," select "Deploy from a branch" as the source.
    *   Choose the branch you pushed your code to (e.g., `main` or `master`).
    *   Select `/ (root)` as the folder.
    *   Click "Save".
    *   GitHub Pages will build your site. It might take a few minutes. Your portfolio will be available at `https://your-github-username.github.io/your-repository-name/`.

6.  **Review and Iterate:**
    *   Check your live portfolio for any formatting issues or broken links.
    *   Ask for feedback from peers or mentors.
    *   Continue to update and refine your projects and portfolio content.

Good luck building your portfolio!
